Fly Away is a simple retro style game where you are playing as a butterflying flying away to save yourself from three dinosaurs, each second equals to a score and the goal is to score as many scores as you can without getting killed by the dinosaurs.

Here are the general instructions:
Start the game by clicking on the green flag.
The butterfly sprite moves with your cursor.
There are a total of three birds which move to random coordinates on the screen.
If the birds touch your butterfly, you'll loose.
The second and third bird are released after a 10 second interval each.
After you lose, click on the green flag to restart the game.

I developed this game as an assignment for my edX Harvard CS50 course, and this is very first work on scratch.
